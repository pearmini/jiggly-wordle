# Jiggly Wordle

I created [Jiggly Recursive Circles](https://observablehq.com/d/af7ef0b292ba9e27) and [Jiggly Texts](https://observablehq.com/d/4917281a258bd936) before, inspired by Paul Buffa's cool [Jiggly Map](https://observablehq.com/@pstuffa/jiggly-map)! After an inspiring chat with [Liwenhan Xie](https://shellywhen.github.io/), I thought I could apply the jiggly animation to a word cloud, similar to what she did in [Emordle](https://shellywhen.github.io/projects/emordle) - animating word clouds for emotion expression. This also seemed like a good chance to try some wonderful fonts provided by [ZETAFONT](https://www.zetafonts.com/)!

Here is the [result](https://wordle.bairui.dev/). I don't know if this word cloud has emotion or not, but it does have a "personality"!

This also reminded me of a top view of a city. So I placed some symbols on the text. Now it's become a Jiggly Symbols City!

Finally, I experimented with colors.

This process has been satisfying. One particularly pleasing aspect was [fixing a bug](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/pull/194) in [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud). Huge thanks to [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/) for making such a fascinating library.
